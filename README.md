Directions:
Round the   relative frequencies and   probabilities to four decimal   places.   Carry   all   other   decimal   answers to   two   places.
Collect   Data:
1.       Use the   data from   Appendix   C   (check   it   from   textbook).   [6]
Use a stratified sampling   method   by   lap   (races   1 to   20)   and   a   random   number generator   to   pick   six   lap times from each stratum.   Record the   lap times   below for   laps two   to   seven.

2.       Construct a   histogram.   Make five   to   six   intervals.   Sketch   the   graph   using   a   ruler   and   pencil.   Scale   the   axes.      [10]

3.         Calculate the following:   [4]

4.       Draw a   smooth   curve   through   the   tops   of the   bars   of   the   histogram.   Write   two   com代 写Regular Statistics Project

(Keep   it simple.   Does the graph go straight   across,   does   it   have   a v-shape,   does   it   have   a   hump   in   the   middle or at   either   end,   and   so   on?)
5.       Use your   sample   mean,   sample   standard   deviation,   and   histogram to   help,   what   is the   approximate   theoretical distribution of the   data?   [6]

6.         Describe the data   [14]

7.       Theoretical   distribution   [14]
Using the theoretical distribution, complete the following statements.   You   should   use   a   normal approximation   based on your sample   data.

8.         Discussion questions   [15]
Use 6 completed sentences to answer   the   following   question.
